## About Ready Now

This single page time management app in React has a backend in Flask and PostgreSQL. Ready Now gets smarter with each use by capturing timestamps with JavaScript timers, sending the data to the server via AJAX fetch requests, and adds new records to the database with SQLAlchemy. That information is aggregated and queried to provide personalized timer estimates for the user.

As the user goes through each step, the projected ETA is recalculated and changes color to reflect any changes to the time. All calculations and color changes are done with conditional logic in JavaScript. Integration of the Twilio API allows the user to directly text a friend as they're using the timers.

The userâ€™s profile page features React-Vis data visualizations of their different activities and completion times.
